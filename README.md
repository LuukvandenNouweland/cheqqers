# Cheqqers

This repository implements quantum checkers.

There are three versions of Quantumness that can be used:
- Classical: Normal Checkers
- SUPERPOSITION: Checkers with only superpositions. This means that checkerpieces are able to exist in superpositions and are measured when they are capturing/being captured
- ENTANGLEMENT: Checkers with entanglement and superpositions. This means that if a piece tries to capture a piece in superposition, they become entangled.
- INTERFERENCE: Checkers with entanglement, superpositions and interference. This means that if a piece tries to capture a piece in superposition, they become entangled.


## Docker
This project lets you play Cheqqers in a Docker container â€” no need to install Python or dependencies locally.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your computer.
- Clone this repository:

### Building the docker image
Navigate to the root directory of this repository and run the following command to build the docker image.
```
docker build -t cheqqers .
```
- `-t cheqqers` tags the image with the name cheqqers for easy reference.
- `.` tells Docker to use the current directory where the Dockerfile lives.

### Run the game interactively
Start the game container and interact with it in your terminal:
```
docker run -it --rm cheqqers
```
- `-it` connects your terminal input/output to the container so you can play.
- `--rm` removes the container once you exit to keep things clean.
- `cheqqers` is the image name from the build step.


## Installing without docker

You'll need Python 3. Check that you have at least version 3.12 with

```
python --version
```

Then create a virtual environment for the dependencies.

```
python -m venv ./cheqqersenv
```

Activate it now (and everytime you want to do something with this project in the shell).

```
source cheqqersenv/bin/activate
```

And install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can play the game in the terminal from main.py.

```
python main.py
```

If you want to play against another player, or a different bot, you can easily change the players in `main.py`.

## Web app

You can play Cheqqers in a GUI using the web app. To do that you need to run the front end and the backend.

The backend can be started with:

```
python -m fastapi dev api.py
```

For the frontend, you will need NPM (at least version 10). Then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

The frontend can be started with:

```
npm run dev
```
