Useful Algorithms

Proof number search is a best-first search algorithm used to solve many games.
L. Victor Allis, Maarten van der Meulen, and H. Jaap van den Herik, “Proof-number Search”, Artificial Intelligence, vol. 66, no. 1, pp. 91-124, March 1994.

Depth-first proof number search is the depth-first search variant.

Proof number search was based on David McAllester’s Conspiracy Numbers algorithm.
David McAllester, “Conspiracy Numbers for Min-Max Search”, Artificial Intelligence, vol. 35, pp. 287-310, 1988.

The graph-history interaction (GHI) problem can cause problems with  proofs. Akihiro Kishimoto and Martin Muller developed a high- performance and accurate solution to this problem (2004).
